assynchronous functions are functions that happen togather
in python they are done using the module asyncio
<.~. rules~.~>
to muse asyncio , you must import asyncio module.
to use the module each method must have an async keyword
in the method or function we will have to use async.gather to put two processes that are running concurrently(together)
each async method can have an await this will wait for the remaining piece of code to work before it
